# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python (Winter in Data Science 2022)





## [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py)
**makemore** is a tool that can take a text file as input and use it to create new similar text. It works by using a type of computer program called a language model, which can understand and generate text. With **makemore**, you can use different types of language models, from simple ones like bigrams to more advanced ones like the Transformer used in GPT. For example, you can give it a list of names and it will create new, unique, realistic names.

In this project, **makemore** has been implemented through a few sample Jupyter notebooks which can be found here:
